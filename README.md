This is a basic game of "rock, paper, scissors" and marks the first project that I have coded from scratch.
My personal goal for this project is to think like a developer and rely on JavaScript documentation available online rather than look for other people's solutions to this problem. 
This project should encompass the majority of my JavaScript learning so far.

The project was not too difficult but I did have to research a few ways of getting the RNG for the computers selection.
