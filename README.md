This is a basic game of "rock, paper, scissors" and marks the first project that I will have coded from scratch.
My personal goal for this project is to think like a developer and rely on JavaScript documentation available online rather than look for other people's solutions to this problem. This project should encompass the majority of my JavaScript learning so far.
