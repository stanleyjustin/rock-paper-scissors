This is a basic game of "rock, paper, scissors" and marks the first project that I have coded from scratch.
My personal goal for this project is to think like a developer and rely on JavaScript documentation available online rather than look for other people's solutions to this problem. 
This project should encompass the majority of my JavaScript learning so far.

The project was not too difficult but I did have to research a few ways of getting the RNG for the computers selection.

How to play!

Eventually a web interface will be added but for now you can open the index.html in a browser.
Right click and inspect element or open developer tools.
Navigate to the console of your developer tools. 
Paste this into the console:
console.log(playRound(playerSelection, computerSelection))
console.log(game())
Then hit run and you will be prompted to enter your selection.
